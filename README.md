Angular Project
In this project, I worked on a simple Angular application where the main idea is to consume an API exposed at the URL:

https://webapiscrape20231218182326.azurewebsites.net/Scheduler/api/tasks/scrape

Two parameters will be sent through a form, which are the CRON expression and the URL. The expected message is ‘CRON task scheduled’
